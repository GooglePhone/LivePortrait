**Once again, we would like to express our heartfelt gratitude for your love, attention, and support for LivePortrait! ðŸŽ‰**

### Updates

- <strong>Portrait video editing (v2v):</strong> Implemented a version of Portrait Video Editing (aka v2v). Ensure you have `pykalman` package installed, which has been added in [`requirements_base.txt`](../../../requirements_base.txt). You can specify the source video using the `-s` or `--source` option,  adjust the temporal smoothness of motion with `--driving_smooth_observation_variance`, enable head pose motion transfer with `flag_video_editing_head_rotation`, and ensure the eye-open scalar of each source frame matches the first source frame before animation with`--flag_source_video_eye_retargeting`.

- <strong>More options in Gradio:</strong> We have upgraded the Gradio interface and added more options. These include `Cropping Options for Source Image or Video` and `Cropping Options for Driving Video`, providing greater flexibility and control.
